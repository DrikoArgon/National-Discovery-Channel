# National-Discovery-Channel
A repository for the scripts created during the development of the game "National Discovery Channel", made in Unity using C#.

National Discovery Channel was developed for the GlobalGameJam 2018 event with the theme: Transmission.

N.D.P. (or National Discovery Planet) is a television channel with documentaries about wildlife in different locations. 3 players go on a job to document different animals in the areas to attract the audience and win a promotion in the channel. The crew consists of a camerawoman, a presenter and a guy responsible for the audio. Players are required to film and capture the sound of the animal while keeping the presenter in front of the camera documenting the creature and the sound guy outside of the camera, to amass audience points in the channel. Players must avoid animal's aggressive behavior.

I was a solo programmer in this project.
